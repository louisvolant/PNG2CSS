PNG2CSS
=======

PNG2CSS is a tool written with python (and the PyPNG Library) to convert PNG files to HTML+CSS files.

Beware, the script doesn't take every kind of PNGs. Save PNGs with MS Paint to be sure the script will correctly take it (there is indeed a issue with PNG and transparency/alpha, that I prensently haven't managed to solve).

The script has only been tested using Python 2.6.
